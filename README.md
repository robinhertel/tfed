The switch from conventional to predictive maintenance promises industrial companies significant
efficiency gains. In practice, however, the successful use of predictive maintenance often fails due
to great uncertainties in the assessment of a system's health status. This project shows how the
current megatrend of the Internet of Things can be utilized to develop a viable and robust estimator
of a system's remaining useful life. In particular, various filter and smoothing methods are
implemented and tested to account for sensor noise. Additionally, a recurrent neural network model
with a stacked LSTM architecture is defined which allows remaining useful life estimation without
the necessity of an underlying structural fault propagation model.
